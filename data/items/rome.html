<h4>"3 Dreams of Black" is an interactive film by Chris Milk and some friends at Google that showcases the creative potential of WebGL.</h4> 

<p>WebGL is a context of the HTML5 canvas element that enables hardware-accelerated 3D graphics in the web browser without a plug-in. In other words, it enables your browser to show some really beautiful visuals. On this page, you'll find a WebGL model viewer featuring several of the "3 Dreams of Black" creatures. You'll also find 8 demos created by our development team, a link to the code base, and some links to resources on the web that will be useful for getting started in WebGL programming.</p>

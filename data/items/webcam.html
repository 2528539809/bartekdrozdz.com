	<h4>Bad reception effect of a webcam feed.</h4>

	<p>Playing with some shaders to create a bad reception effect. Move your mouse around (or tap anywhere on a mobile device) to change the effect and its intensity. For video, it uses the camera feed provided by the WebRTC API.</p>

	<p><em>Note:</em> Be sure to click <b>Allow</b> on the toolbar above.</p>

	<p><em>Technology:</em> WebGL, WebRTC</p>

	<div class="webrtc warning">You need a WebGL and WebRTC enabled browser run this experiment. <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> on desktop and Android is currently the only browser to support those both APIs.</div>

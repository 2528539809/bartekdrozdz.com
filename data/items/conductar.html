	<h4>Installation comissioned for Moogfest 2014</h4>

	<p>An immersive agumented-reality experience, layered on top of the city of Asheville, North Carolina where the <a href="http://www.moogfest.com/">Moogfest</a> festival takes place. The attendeed are invited to wander the city and conduct a generative audio-visual world through movement and their neurological response to the environment. Inspired by the psychogeorgraphical concept of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive">d√©rive</a>", the installation runs on a mobile app connected to a brainwave sensor. As the festival goers drift from one venue to the next, they are collectively composing new electronic music with the electrical activity of their brains.

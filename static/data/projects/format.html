<h4>In 2010, I had the pleasure to work with Anrick Bregman and Luciano Foglia from Unit9 on a visual experiment called Format Journey.</h4>

<p>The installation uses data – a series of images and a sound file – to modify the texture and the shape of a 3D object. Combined with a slight randomization it gives very nice and unpredictable results.</p>

<p>The installation is part of a project called Tango and Hawaii created by Anrick and Luciano. Be sure to check the live demo. It was originally presented at the Magdalena Festival in Maribor, Slovenia.</p>

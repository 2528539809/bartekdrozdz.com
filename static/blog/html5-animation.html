		<h3>Animations can make your website stand out of the crowd. Good animations enchance the <a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com/" target="_blank">user interface</a>, make navigation feel smooth and offer superior esthetic experience. Modern browsers support animations quite well, but there are so many different ways of animating HTML elements that it often confuses even experienced developers.</h3>

		<p>This the the first part of a series aimed at exploring HTML5 animation in depth. There will be three parts that will cover the following topics:</p>
		
		<ol class="anim-types">
			<li>Frame-by-frame animation</li>
			<li>CSS Transitions</li>
			<li>CSS Animations</li>
		</ol>

		<p><em>For the sake of completeness, I need to add that there are ways to animate shapes in SVG as well as inside WebGL shaders. Both are interesting but very specific so I decided to leave them out.</em></p>

		<p>In this first article, we will focus on frame-by-frame animation. You will learn how easy it is to create an animation loop in Javascript using the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> function and animate CSS properties of HTML elements inside it with some simple math. This article assumes that you have a basic knowledge of web development so that you can create a properly formated HTML document and add some Javascript to it. No advanced Javascript knowledge is not required. You also do not need to know any animation related math.</p>

		<p>The other two articles on CSS Transitions and CSS Animations are on the way so keep an eye on this page or follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/bartekd">@bartekd</a> to get notified when they are released!</p>
		
		<p>Ok, without further ado, let's dive right in!</p>

		<h3>1. Interpolation</h3>

		<p>The frame-by-frame technique is based on a Javascript implementation of the basic idea of animation, that is of changing the value of a property over time. To understand how to achieve this you need to get familiar with the concept of interpolation, which is fundamental to any animation.</p>

		<p>Let's take a practical example: we want to animate a property from <code>0</code> to <code>200</code> in 2 second. This value can express anything - a postion, a rotation etc. To find the value at any given time in between the start and end, we use interpolation. The formula is:</p>

		<code>value = start + (end - start) * (time / duration);</code>

		<p>What it basically means is that you need to calculate how far from start and how close to the end you are at the given time.</p>

		<p>Dividing the time by the duration gives us a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the beginning of the animation, and 1 is the end. As you will see later, there are some big advantages to keeping the value of the time in 0-1 range. I would also recommend reading this great <a href="http://sol.gfxile.net/interpolation/" target="_blank">article</a> on interpolation.</p>

		<p>If we want to calculate the position of the object 0.5 sec after the animation started, we simply plug the values from the example above to the formula, we get:</p>

		<code>value = 0 + (200 - 0) * (0.5 / 2);
		value = 0 + (200 * 0.25);
		value = 0 + 50;
		value = 50;</code>

		<p>Simply elemntary school grade math, right? And here's an example of the equation for a start value of 50 and end value of 100</p>

		<code>value = 50 + (100 - 50) * (0.5 / 2);
		value = 50 + (50 * 0.25);
		value = 50 + 12.5;
		value = 62.5;</code>

		<p>Before we jump into details on how to implement this with Javascipt however, we need to talk about DOM elements and the CSS properties that we want to animate.</p>

		<h3>2. CSS Transform</h3>

		<p>In our simple example we want to move an object on screen by modifying it's position. The way to do it is to change the object's CSS properties in with Javascript code.</p>

		<p>So let's start with defining an HTML element that we want to animate:</p>

		<code>&lt;div id="#redbox"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-01"></div>
		</div>

		<p>While there are a few CSS properties that can move an object, the best option is to change the value of the CSS <code>transform</code> property. The reason for this is performance, since changing the valus of this property doesn't require a document reflow. It is all very eloquently explained in <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/" target="_blank">this article</a>, so be sure to read it later.</p>

		<p>To move our object to the initial position of x = 100px we can say:</p>

		<code>var redbox = document.querySelector("#redbox");
		redbox.style["transform"] = "translateX(100px)";</code>

		<p>If you are not familiar with the <code>querySelector</code> function, it returns an element from the DOM using a CSS selector syntax. If you want to get an element by id, you will just pass the id prefixed with a hash in the same way as you would define styles for this id in CSS. In the same way you can select elements by their classes using the <code>.className</code> notation. <code>querySelector</code> also works with more complex selectors, so be sure to try it out!</p>

		<p>In the next line we simply set the CSS <code>transform</code> property to the value we want. This could be that simple, but unfortunately the <code>transform</code> property is polluted with vendor prefixes. There are many ways to deal with this, and I invite you to figure out the most elegant one, but for now let's use a quick-and-dirty way and wrap the whole thing into a function:</p>

		<code>function setX(element, x) {
		&nbsp;&nbsp;var t = "translateX(" + x + "px)";
		&nbsp;&nbsp;var s = element.style;
		&nbsp;&nbsp;s["transform"] = t;
		&nbsp;&nbsp;s["webkitTransform"] = t;
		&nbsp;&nbsp;s["mozTransform"] = t;
		&nbsp;&nbsp;s["msTransform"] = t;
		}</code>

		<p>Now our code looks like this:</p>

		<code>var redbox = document.getElementById("redbox");
		setX(redbox, 100);</code>

		<p>Please note that a function like this, that only sets the x translation value is not very robust. In your production code you might want to write a function or an object with a few methods to deal with all possible transform values. Here's <a href="https://github.com/drojdjou/bartekdrozdz.com/blob/master/static/src/framework/domExtend/Transform.js#L31-L72" target="_blank">one</a> I use.</p>

		<p>Here's the result: our box is moved 100 pixels to the right.</p>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-02"></div>
		</div>

		<h3>3. Animation loop</h3>

		<p>Now that you know how to set the elements position, we can start moving it around. In order to animate the red box, we will need to call a function repeatedly in short intervals and each time interpolate the position of the box until it reaches the end. In order to do this, you need to get familiar with the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> function that exists in modern browsers. This function is still prefixed in some browsers so make sure to include <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/" target="_blank">the polyfill</a> in your code - the code below assumes you did that.</p>

		<p>The <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> function is simple - it takes one argument, where you can pass a reference to another function and it will be invoked the next time the browser repaints the screen. Typically it is 60 times per second.</p>

		<p>That way it works it to define a function called <code>loop</code> or <code>run</code> (or whatever you like) that calls the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> and passes itself as argument. On top of that you can add a flag to control starting and stopping the loop.</p>

		<code>function run() {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;requestAnimationFrame(run);
			&nbsp;&nbsp;// Animation code goes here
			}

			run();
		</code>

		<p>Calling <code>run()</code> for the first time will start the loop because it will keep invoking itself through <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. Below you can see the code in action, just press the Start button to start the loop.</p>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-03">0</div>
		</div>

		<ul class="buttons">
			<li id="redbox-btn-01">Start</li>
			<li id="redbox-btn-02">Stop</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>4. Timing</h3>

		<p>We could move the object by an even amount of pixels on every frame and expect a steady pace of animation, but the problem is that there is no guarantee that our animation function will be invoked at consistent time intervals. Depending on browser,k CPU, other Javascript code and many other factors, the frame rate can drop below 60 FPS. It's much better to use some kind of timer to test the actual time of the animaton. For this we can use the built-in <code>Date</code> object. In the future it will be replaced by <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/08/When-milliseconds-are-not-enough-performance-now" target="_blank"><code>window.performance</code></a>, but it's not widely supported yet (when it is supported I will update this section, promised!)</p>

		<p>The idea of measuring time is simple: when the animation starts, save the current time to a variable called <code>startTime</code>. Then, at each frame, subtract <code>startTime</code> from current time - the result says how much time passed since the animation started. Here's the loop code with time measurement added:</p>

		<code>var startTime, time;
			function run() {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;requestAnimationFrame(run);
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = new Date().getTime() - startTime;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;// Animation code goes here
			}

			startTime = new Date().getTime();
			run();

		</code>

		<p>And here is the updated demo:</p>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-04">0ms</div>
		</div>

		<ul class="buttons">
			<li id="redbox-btn-03">Start</li>
			<li id="redbox-btn-04">Stop</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>5. Animation sequence</h3>

		<p>Still there? Hang on for a little bit more, we're almost done. Now that we can tell the time of the animation, we can stop the loop when the animation is done.</p>

		<p>We introduce a new variable that will define the duration of the animation. The <code>new Date().getTime()</code> method returns time in milliseonds, so let's use this unit from now on - 2 seconds become 2000 milliseconds.</p>

		<code>var startTime, time;
			var duration = 2000;
			function run() {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = new Date().getTime() - startTime;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = time / duration;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;if(time < 1) requestAnimationFrame(run);
			&nbsp;&nbsp;// Animation code goes here
			}
			
			startTime = new Date().getTime();
			run();

			start();
		</code>

		<p>Notice how in the code above I divide the time by the duration? That way the <code>time</code> variable is in the 0-1 range and I test if <code>time < 1</code> to know if the animation is over. This is the single most important lesson in animation, so I will repeat it: <em>always keep your time in 0-1 range!</em></p>

		<p>Here's this code at work. You can set any duration in the input field below and see how the animation loop runs for the specified duration, but whatever the duration the time value is always going from 0 to 1. This way we can animate our elements the same way regardless of the duration.</p>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-05">0ms</div>
		</div>

		<div class="input">
			Duration <input type="text" value="2000" id="redbox-input-01"> ms.
		</div>

		<ul class="buttons">
			<li id="redbox-btn-05">Start</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>6. Making things move</h3>

		<p>The red box has been sitting there for a while, now let's make it move! To do that, we will add two new variables: <code>startX</code> that defines the starting postion and <code>endX</code> that says where the element should be at the end of the animation.</p>

		<code>var startTime, time;
			var duration = 2000;
			var startX = 0, endX = 200;

			function run() {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = new Date().getTime() - startTime;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = time / duration;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;if(time < 1) requestAnimationFrame(run);
			&nbsp;&nbsp;setX(redBox, startX + (startX - endX) / time);
			}
			
			startTime = new Date().getTime();
			run();
		</code>

		<p>To run this you need a reference to the div object as well as the <code>setX</code> function - we discussed both earlier.</p>

		<p>You can see how I plug the interpolation formula to get the interpolated value at each frame:</p>

		<code>startX + (startX - endX) / time</code>

		<p>That is the essential part of the code and the one that makes the movement possible. Here's a demo:</p>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-06"></div>
		</div>

		<div class="input">
			Duration <input type="text" value="2000" id="redbox-input-02"> ms.
		</div>

		<ul class="buttons">
			<li id="redbox-btn-06">Start</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>7. Easing</h3>

		<p>You've seen how having the time in 0-1 range can make your life easier. Now you will see how it is also quite powerful.</p>

		<p>If you used a tweening engine or did animation with CSS before, you are certainly familiar with the concept of easing. Easing is used to accelerate, slow down or otherwise alter the animation in different ways. It helps making your animations smooth and beautiful.</p>

		<p>The good news is that it is simple to implement. Think of easing as a function to which you pass the current time and it returns it back, slightly modified. That returned value is what you use in the interpolation equation instead.</p>

		<p>To add easing to our animation, let's add two things to the code.</p>

		<p>First - a new function. Let's call it <code>easeIn</code>. It takes an argument <code>t</code> and returns it squared - <code>t * t</code>. What it does, is that the returned value will grow slower than the value passed to it: <code>0.5</code> will return <code>0.25</code>, <code>0.8</code> will return <code>0.64</code> etc. This causes the animation to start at a slower pace and then gradually accelerate.</p>

		<p>The beauty and elegance of this solution is that there are a lot of different functions that result in different effects and you can simply plug-in and use them with your animation. We will see some more below. There is one trick though! Those functions only work if the value of <code>t</code> is between 0-1, so now you can see why it was so important!</p>

		<p>The other thing we add is inside the <code>run</code> function. We take the time, pass it to the easing function and save the result back in the same variable. After this we do the interpolation in the same way as we did before, but now <code>time</code> has already the easing applied to it.</p>

		<code>var startTime, time;
			var duration = 2000;
			var startX = 0, endX = 200;

			function easeIn(t) {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;return t * t;
			}

			function run() {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = new Date().getTime() - startTime;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = time / duration;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;if(time < 1) requestAnimationFrame(run);
			&nbsp;&nbsp;time = easeIn(time);
			&nbsp;&nbsp;setX(redBox, startX + (startX - endX) / time);
			}
			
			startTime = new Date().getTime();
			run();
		</code>

		<p>See the effect yourself below.</p>

		<div class="demo">
			<div class="redbox" id="redbox-07"></div>
		</div>

		<div class="input">
			Duration <input type="text" value="2000" id="redbox-input-03"> ms.
		</div>

		<ul class="buttons">
			<li id="redbox-btn-07">Start</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The animation has a subtle but visible effect where it starts slowly and then accelerates towards the end. If you think the effect is not strong enough, try changing the easing function to this:</p>

		<code>function easeIn(t) {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;return t * t * t * t;
			}
		</code>

		<p>This easing equation what is typically called <code>quadEaseIn</code>, where quad means that we raise <code>t</code> to the power 4.</p>

		<p>Another very useful easing function is called smoothstep. This one will make the object gently accelerate at the beginning and then slow down towards the end - it is perfect for all kinds of UI transitions. Here's the fomula:</p>

		<code>function smoothstep(t) {
			&nbsp;&nbsp;return t * t * (3 - 2 * t);
			}
		</code>

		<p>Add it to your code and don't forget to change the name of the function inside <code>run</code>. Now it should say:</p>

		<code>time = smoothstep(time);</code>

		<p>Many other easing functions are easy to find on the web. They are part of virtually every tweening engine out there, so just take a look at the source and you'll find them. I encourage you to experiment, change values, break things - this is the best way to learn. Who knows, maybe you will invent new easing formulas!</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<p>By now you probably understand the reason this technique is called frame-by-frame animation. It is based on code executed at every frame that calculates the current values and updates the CSS properties.<p>
		
		<p>This technique is universal. We used it above to move a DOM element, but we could as well use it to move around shapes drawn with Canvas 2d or WebGL. It can even be used outside of the browser in any visual programing environment including moving physical stuff with things like Arduino. The only thing that changes is the way to run the loop - each language has it's own way of dealing with this.</p>
		
		<p>Frame-by-frame is very hackable. You can change and tweak every part of the system and see the results. You can implement things like pausing, reversing or repeating the animation or create a timeline system where a master animation controls the pace of other animations. You can come up with some exotic easing equations or tweak other parameters to achieve unique results.</p>

		<p>If you used a 3rd party animation engine before and you thought that building one must be very a complex task, then I hope this article proves that in fact it is not so complicated. Of course it takes work to create an animation engine, and covering this in depth goes beyone the scope of this article, but the basic philosophy of such engine is outlined above.</p>

		<p>You need to know however that, in the context of web development, this flexibility comes at a price. Since the animation is executed in Javascript, it has a bigger performance impact that the two other techniques - CSS Transitions and CSS Animations. In the next two installments of this series I will explain how those CSS-based techniques work and how to use them in your projects.</p>

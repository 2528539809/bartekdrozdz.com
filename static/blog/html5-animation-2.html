		<h4>This the second article exploring HTML5 animation. It focuses on CSS Transitions. In the first article I discussed frame-by-frame animations, which is a technique that relies on Javascript. CSS Transitions can be used without Javascript at all, however you will need to add some script to make them truly useful. On the up side, they offer silky smooth performance with very little jank.</h4>

		<p>I think CSS Transitions are the most misunderstood feature in CSS. Maybe this is because most developers are used to tweening engines where they call a function, pass an object along with some paramaters which fires the animation once and that's it. CSS Transtions do not work that way. If added in CSS they are permanent and are fired each time you change the a CSS property of the object they are attached to. This often confuses people and leads to messy code and poor performance - I've been there.</h3>
